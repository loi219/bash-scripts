# Bash scripts of Amadeous

You will find here some of my bash script, free to use.
Some script require some other scripts (some from mine). However, you're free to
edit the script to remove those dependancies.

Here is a list of the required scripts:
- Backup scripts requires mountNFSVolumes
- dailyBackup requires backupExclude
- flac2folder uses the marvellous script flac2mp3
